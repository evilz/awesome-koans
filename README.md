## Learn with kōans

> The Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn new languages. The goal is to learn the language, syntax, structure, and some common functions and libraries. We also teach you culture. Testing is not just something we pay lip service to, but something we live. It is essential in your quest to learn and do great things in the language.
